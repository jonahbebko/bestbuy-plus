# Best Buy Plus 0.1.0

## Overview

Best Buy Plus is a Vite PWA + React app meant to be a native-like replacement of the Best Buy mobile app made for employees of Best Buy.

## Motivation

As an employee at Best Buy myself, I find it extremely frustrating when I go to look up a product for a customer and having to wait in the worst case a full 15 seconds for the page to load in the Best Buy mobile app. Not only is the app bloated with (to me) useless AI tools and advertisements but it frequently contains misleading and confusing info about product availability, like saying "this product is available" (at a nearby store) in the same place it would typically say a product is actually available in my store. Best Buy Plus is supposed to be nothing more than an API wrapper - fast, simple, and functional. I plan to add all the nice-to-haves that the regular app does, like product UPC scanning and member/employee ID QR codes. I hope that Best Buy Plus will completely eliminate my need to use the Best Buy app at all on the clock.

## Try it out!

Best Buy Plus will eventually be hosted [on my website](https://jonahbebko.com/bestbuy-plus) once the app is out of its development phase.
